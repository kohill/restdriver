# RESTDriver

Designed to harness all the basic needs of, currently, RestAssured.  The intent here is to centralize service testing
capabilities of REST and SOA and take out the difficulty that some tools have.  RestAssured is currently plugged
in as the tool, but can be swapped with any other open-source tool.

### Capabilities
#### - Data Driven testing, a low-code solution
#### - Method driven testing, 1 test per Java method 

## Release Notes

#### 1.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT: Initial upload
